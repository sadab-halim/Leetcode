## [Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

*Example 1:* <br/>
*Input:* s = "abcd", t = "abcde" <br/>
*Output:* "e" <br/>
*Explanation:* 'e' is the letter that was added. 

*Example 2:* <br/>
*Input:* s = "", t = "y" <br/>
*Output:* "y" <br/>

### Solution
```
char findTheDifference(string s, string t){
    for(int i=0; i<s.size(); i++){
        t[i+1] += t[i] - s[i];
    }
    return t[s.size() - 1];
}
```
